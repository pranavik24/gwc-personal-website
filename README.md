This is my personal website
I developed this website as a project for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in June 2022. 

## What I Learned
Through this project, I got more comfortable with creating web pages with HTML and styling them with CSS. In the future, I want to create more responsive websites, and also add more content to this page.
